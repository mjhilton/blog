        <h2>How to Win Friends and Influence People</h1>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Any fool can criticize, complain, and condemn - and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.</p>
          <footer>Dale Carnegie</footer>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Living at high speed, with high aspirations and high expectations, it's easy to be disappointed. It's easy to become cynical and negative. It's easy to blame others. With life running to a backdrop of unmet expectation, it's no surprise that we find ourselves operating under defensive assumptions - that the rest of the world is stupid, aggressive, uncharitable or apathetic. This is the mode of operation I found myself in when I picked up Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People".</p>

        <p>First published in the 1930s, the style of writing is distinctive of its time, and could definitely be seen as dated. The content however, not so. A stranger on a plane related to me the story of her grandfather, who ran a sales team - she knew of the book because he highly recommended it to all of his staff and friends; as such, she was somewhat confused as to why a 20-something would be reading it. She questioned whether it was even relevant today.</p>

        <p>My response - I don't think it could ever have been more relevant. The overarching theme of its guidance the art of conversation, of courtesy and chivalry, of showing interest in other people. The crux of the book - everyone longs to feel important, valued and safe. To understand and cater to this longing, is to wield a great deal of power and influence.</p>

        <p>As I worked through the four sections of the volume - "Techniques in handling people", "Techniques to make people like you", "Winning people to your way of thinking", and "Being a leader" - definite patterns emerged. Each of Carnegie's points are "proven" primarily via anecdotal evidence. The same story tends to be told over and over with different actors, until the idea is burned into your brain. Effective, but eventually it got a bit tired.</p>

        <p>The thing that impressed upon me most was how much of the advice was about taking a selfless approach in dealing with people. Some of the more striking pieces of advice included:
          <ul>
            <li>Don't criticise, condemn or complain</li>
            <li>Give honest and sincere appreciation</li>
            <li>Be genuinely interested in other people and their story</li>
            <li>Listen with undivided attention</li>
            <li>Smile</li>
            <li>Admit when you're wrong, quickly and emphatically</li>
            <li>Call attention to mistakes indirectly</li>
            <li>Let the other person save face</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>What saddened me is that while I felt these ideas border on common sense, they are also far removed from the way I've learned to behave in work and social circles. The heartening flipside is that, once these behavioural anti-patterns are in your field of vision, they're much more within our control to begin to shift. Implementing these suggestions aren't easy, unlike the default behaviours and attitudes we adapt to cope with a crazy world. But they're effective, and generally they're much gentler ways of operating.</p>
