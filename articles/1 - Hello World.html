        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My name's Matt Hilton. I currently work as a developer for <a href="http://www.readify.net">Readify</a> - Microsoft Gold Partner, Microsoft Software Development Partner of the Year 2012, and BRW Top 50 Best Places to Work 2010-2012. Prior to joining Readify in 2012, I worked as a developer with ING DIRECT Australia where I started as a graduate developer. I began my tertiary education at UTS, completing  a Bachelor of Information Technology - a co-operative education program with industry partners, where I was lucky enough to be able to complete my course in 3 years, including a year of Industry Experience (2x 6-month industry placements with sponsor companies).</p>
        <h2>What drives me</h2>
        <p>I love bringing technical expertise together with analysis and soft-skills, to take a more holistic view of software development. Things that give me a thrill include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple technical solutions bringing out-of-proportion benefit/usability to the users of a system</li>
            <li>Simple automation making devs' lives easier and removing unnecessary pain</li>
            <li>Deleting code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In short, my philosophy is quite succinctly summarised by the title of a blog whose author has had a great influence on my professional development in the past 4 years: <a href="http://www.simpleprogrammer.com">Making the Complex Simple</a>. Unfortunately I'll have to come up with a different title for my blog, as plagiarism is bad even on the internet. If you don't know of <a href="https://twitter.com/jsonmez">John Sonmez</a>, I highly recommend his blog. Check it out; it will change your mind.</p>
        <h2>Why I'm starting this blog</h2>
        <h3>Timing</h3>
        <p>I've been meaning to start blogging for a while now. As with lots of things, I've let perceived obstacles get in the way. However, I heard a friend and colleague from Readify say something the other day which spurred me to action. "It's just a blog", said <a href="https://twitter.com/shiftkey">Brendan</a>, explaining that he uses no blog engine; just plain old HTML. So I'm taking the "minimum viable product" approach. I'm not a designer; the CSS will have to wait. Content is key. </p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>My motivation is largely selfish. I read an article this week which described the writing/teaching process as being largely comprised of refining your own thoughts. It's also an exercise in beginning to develop a personal brand in the public arena. It's a place to get my ideas out there and open discussions with interesting people.</p>
        <p style="display: none;">Additionally, and on a more personal level, I was recently diagnosed with Coeliac's disease. While not technically correct, in a simple sense it means I'm allergic to gluten. Starting my journey to living gluten-free, I've found the resources available online a bit lacking (especially regionally specific to Sydney). I hope to contribute to improving this by blogging about my research, experiences, products and restaurants.</p>
        <h3 style="display: none;">Content</h3>
        <p style="display: none;">I plan for there to be two main themes to this blog. One side will be professional: technical ideas/thoughts/frameworks, productivity, cool stuff. The other side will  be more personal - I'm a big food fan, so the Coeliac diagnosis was a huge shock and quite a lifestyle change. As above, you may have gathered that I can't <em>stand</em> unnecessary repetition of work. Hopefully the foodie side will help others to benefit from my experience and "doing the legwork".</p>
        <h2>Wrap</h2>
        <p>Thanks for your interest in my musings. I hope you get something useful from this blog.</p>
