# Hello World

## Introduction

My name's Matt Hilton. I currently work as a developer for [Readify](http://www.readify.net) - Microsoft Gold Partner, Microsoft Software Development Partner of the Year 2012, and BRW Top 50 Best Places to Work 2010-2012. Prior to joining Readify in 2012, I worked as a developer with ING DIRECT Australia where I started as a graduate developer. I began my tertiary education at UTS, completing  a Bachelor of Information Technology - a co-operative education program with industry partners, where I was lucky enough to be able to complete my course in 3 years, including a year of Industry Experience (2x 6-month industry placements with sponsor companies).

## What drives me

I love bringing my technical expertise together with analysis and soft-skills, to take a more holistic view of software development. Things that give me a thrill include:

* Simple technical solutions bringing out-of-proportion benefit/usability to the users of a system
* Simple automation making devs' lives easier and removing unnecessary pain
* Deleting code

In short, my philosophy is quite succinctly summarised by the title of a blog whose author has had a great influence on my professional development in the past 4 years: [Making the Complex Simple](http://www.simpleprogrammer.com). Unfortunately I'll have to come up with a different title for my blog, as plagiarism is bad even on the internet. If you don't know of [John Sonmez](https://twitter.com/jsonmez), I highly recommend his blog. Check it out; it will change your mind.

## Why I'm starting this blog

### Timing
I've been meaning to start blogging for a while now. As with lots of things, I've let perceived obstacles get in the way. However, I heard a friend and colleague from Readify say something the other day which spurred me to action. "It's just a blog", said [Brendan](https://twitter.com/shiftkey), explaining that he uses no blog engine; just plain old HTML. So I'm taking the "minimum viable product" approach. I'm not a designer; the CSS will have to wait. Content is key. 

### Motivation
Most of my motivation is selfish. I read an article this week which described the writing/teaching process as being largely comprised of refining your own thoughts. It's also an exercise in beginning to develop a personal brand in the public arena. It's a place to get my ideas out there and open discussions with interesting people.

Additionally, and on a more personal level, I was recently diagnosed with Coeliac's disease. While not technically correct, in a simple sense it means I'm allergic to gluten. Starting my journey to living gluten-free, I've found the resources available online a bit lacking (especially regionally specific to Sydney). I hope to contribute to improving this by blogging about my research, experiences, products and restaurants.

### Content
I plan for there to be two main themes to this blog. One side will be professional: technical ideas/thoughts/frameworks, productivity, cool stuff. The other side will  be more personal - I'm a big food fan, so the Coeliac diagnosis was a huge shock and quite a lifestyle change. As above, you may have gathered that I can't *stand* unnecessary repetition of work. Hopefully the foodie side will help others to benefit from my experience and "doing the legwork".

## Wrap
Thanks for your interest in my musings. I hope you get something useful from this blog.
